        <h1 class = 'about'>Little Bit About Me!</h1>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Vaidehi Sapre, and this is my space on the web where you can get to know me more. 
            I live in Pleasanton, California which is the home of Silicon Valley.
            I hold a Masters in Accounting and Finance and am currently learning to be 
            a Fullstack Developer with Code The Dream. My journey into coding began while
            I was working with my daughter's school PTA, managing and creating content for 
            their PTA Website. I had somuch fun doing it and now am very passionate about it too.
            In my free time I enjoy paying tennis, gardening, knitting, and hiking. I believe in sharing
            and I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building fantastic 
            looking websites.
        </p>
